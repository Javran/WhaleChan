  design draft:

  - note that rate limit applies on a per-user per-application basis
    which means we have 900 calls for a 15 min window in total

  - for each 10 seconds, retrieve without since_id and with count=200

    + we'll be using 6 per min * 15 = 90 calls, way below the limit for a decent response time.
    + the intention of not using since_id is to retrieve tweet ids
      of the past so that deletion can be detected
    + talk to telegramThread when there's a need of sending messages

  - also for each 10 seconds, get account icon & user following count
    (TODO: this part is not planned in implementation yet)

  - the whole process will be:

    + get tweets and notify about changes (if any)
    + sleep for 5 seconds
    + get account icon & other info, notify about changes (if any)
    + sleep for 5 seconds
    + <loop>

  data structure:

  - see below

  - all detected tweet or deleted tweet will be sent to telegram thread exactly once,
    we'll notify about failure in log (and will never retry for simplicity)

  - the sequence will have a lower bound and upper bound of length limit,
    when upon hitting the upper bound, old items are removed from front until
    reaching lower bound. or in other words, we don't want to keep track of too many messages
    and neither do we want to do cleanup too often.

  - initial limit might be just lower bound = 5, upper bound = 10 to see if it works correctly.
  - tentative limit: lower bound = 512, upper bound = 1024 after correctness can be confirmed.
